   <h3>key Concepts</h3>
   <ol>
    <li>
        Tags and Elements
        <ul><li>
            <p>Tags are enclosed in angular brackets, e.g., <tag>.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Elements consist of opening tags, content, and closing tags, 
            </p>
        </li>
    
    </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        HTML tags are classified :
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>Paired Tags or Container tags: Paired tags have both opening and closing tags, and they enclose content between them. For example, <p> and </p> in the above example</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Self-Closing Tags or Empty tags or Void tags: Self-closing tags do not have a separate closing tag, and they are used to insert elements that do not contain any content or do not require closing. For example, <img> for an image element, or br for a line break.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </li>
   </ol>
   <h2>Definations</h2>
   <dl>
    <dt>Heading tags in html
        <dd>

        </dd>
    </dt>
    <dt>Preformatted Tag
        <dd>
            pre This tag is used for preformatted text. It preserves spaces, line breaks, and formatting as they are in the HTML code.
        </dd>

    <dt>Paragraph tags
        <dd>
            This tag is used to define a paragraph. It is a block-level element and automatically adds some space before and after the content
        </dd>
    </dt>
    <dt>Attributes
        <dd>
            Attributes provide additional information about an element and are specified within the opening tag of the element. Attributes consist of a name and a value, separated by an equals sign (=), and are enclosed within the element's opening tag in quotation marks (single or double).
        </dd>
    </dt>
    <dt>Comments
        <dd>
            comments are used to insert notes or annotations within the code that are ignored by the web browser when rendering the webpage.
